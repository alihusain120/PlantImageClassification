# PlantImageClassification
Two-part Kaggle class challenge to classify fine-grained images of plants

This repo contains experiments and final models used in Boston University's CS542 - Machine Learning final competition project. Under /results you will find the final 
output CSV files used in submission on Kaggle, the models used to produce them are under models/final models/. Inside of models/drafts/ are multiple experiments and
sub-process models tested and ran before finalizing the architectures.

The final models used transfer learning on Google's Inception V3, the first model submission made full use of a supervised transfer learning approach, the second submission
utilized some more preprocessing steps for the semi-supervised challenge.
